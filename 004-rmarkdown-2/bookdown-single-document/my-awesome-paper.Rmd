# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

# Methods

These are some totally awesome methods that I'll be discussing in my book. As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(introduction) this book discussed a range of method including method 1 [@wood-2017] and method 2 that was first introduced by @pedersen-2019.

There's some other papers on this topic that are complete rubbish [see for example @simpson-2018].

# Results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Look at this totally awesome result!", fig.pos='tbhf', fig.align='centre'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pressure), you will see my totally awesome result.

Table \@ref(tab:results-table) also shows some frikkin awesome results in table form!

```{r results-table}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:10, 1:8], booktabs = TRUE, caption = "A table of totally awesome results!")
```
