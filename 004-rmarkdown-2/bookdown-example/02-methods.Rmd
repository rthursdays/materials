# Methods

These are some totally awesome methods that I'll be discussing in my book. As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(introduction) this book discussed a range of method including method 1 [@wood-2017] and method 2 that was first introduced by @pedersen-2019.

There was some code referenced in Section \@ref(include-code).
