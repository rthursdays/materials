# Introduction {#introduction}

Here I introduce my totally awesome book.

## Including Code {#include-code}

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, fig.cap="A figure caption for this awesome figure"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).
